**The Federal Funds Rate**

So far, we've talked about how the feds can control the money supply by performing open market transactions where they're buying and selling Treasury securities. But you might be thinking, "I don't hear a lot of open market transactions and Treasury bond buying." I hear them setting the federal funds rate, the discount rate, or the target rate. "What are these words, and how do they relate to open market transactions?"

We'll focus on the target rate. This is the rate that the Fed wants banks to lend reserves to each other on a very short-term basis. The reserves of the bank are the assets of the Federal Reserve. Let's assume that one bank's reserve is lower than the other. One has a reserve of 10%, and another has a reserve of 20%. Bank B has too much reserve, but he doesn't like that much reserve because you don't get interest on the reserve.So Bank B opts for a 15% reserve, whereas Bank A wishes to increase to a 15% reserve.So bank A wants to borrow that amount of money, which is either physical cash or reserve deposits with the Fed. Bank B has roughly that much money to lend. So bank B wants to lend money to bank A, probably overnight because people may want their money back suddenly.

So what interest rate does bank B charge to bank A?

Assume that Bank B will charge a 10% fee. Let's also say the feds decide the money supply isn't big enough. That the Fed wants to expand the money supply So what happens in this situation?

So what the Fed does is print notes and use those notes to buy Treasury bills. The cash will go to the people who sold the treasuries, and that person is going to put that cash in their bank. Some put it in bank A, and some in bank B. What's the net effect? The Fed's balance sheet increased a little bit; it took on some treasuries from the open market, and more cash got deposited in the banking system. All of a sudden, bank A needs less money because it received some reserve deposits from people. Maybe that bank now has a 12% reserve ratio, and bank B has gone from 20% to 22%. The demand for money at Bank A has decreased, and Bank B now has even more money to lend.

Now, for overnight lending, the demand has gone down and the supply has gone up. The price has got to go down for a little borrowing overnight. What's the price of borrowing? That is, after all, the interest rate. Maybe the transaction will occur at an 8% interest rate, and maybe the Fed has a target rate of 5%. So they'd just keep going through the motions.

The Federal Reserve always refers to the target rate as X. They don't talk about money. Bank B will have more reserves than Bank A before the Fed does anything. As a result, bank B may lend to other banks that require reserves or open checking accounts.Let's say bank A wants to borrow, bank B is willing to lend some, and the current rate is 6%.

Now the Federal Reserve wants to expand the money supply, which they don't tell us directly. They will say, "We're going to lower the federal funds rate to 5%." This means that their target rate is now 5%. They're going to perform open market transactions in such a way that now when the bank B offers money to the bank A, it's going to reduce its rate from 6% to 5%.

So the Federal Reserve could print some notes and buy treasuries with them. Regardless of where they purchase it, the seller will have no idea that he's selling to the Federal Reserve. The seller will look like he's selling to the market, just as if he were buying stock. You don't know from whom you're buying stock from.Now that the IOU has been exchanged for dollar bills, which he's going to deposit in the banking system, he might put some in bank A and some in bank B.

Now the bank's reserve ratio has gotten a little bit better. Its assets and liabilities have increased. The bank doesn't need money as badly to improve its reserve ratio, and bank B has an even better reserve ratio. The bank A demand for reserve ratio is a little bit lower, and the bank B supply is a little bit higher. Bank A will be willing to pay a little less for the reserves from bank B, and bank B is willing to charge less. So just by increasing the supply and decreasing the demand for reserves, if the Fed does this appropriately, it will go down to 5%. So they're increasing banks' lending capacity, which significantly increases M1.
