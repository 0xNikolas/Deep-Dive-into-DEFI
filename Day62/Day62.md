**The Federal Funds Rate**

So far, we've talked about how the feds can control the money supply by performing open market transactions where they're buying and selling Treasury securities. But you might be thinking, "I don't hear a lot of open market transactions and Treasury bond buying." I hear them setting the federal funds rate, the discount rate, or the target rate. "What are these words, and how do they relate to open market transactions?"

We'll focus on the target rate. This is the rate that the Fed wants banks to lend reserves to each other on a very short-term basis. The reserves of the bank are the assets of the Federal Reserve. Let's assume that one bank's reserve is lower than the other. One has a reserve of 10%, and another has a reserve of 20%. Bank B has too much reserve, but he doesn't like that much reserve because you don't get interest on the reserve.So Bank B opts for a 15% reserve, whereas Bank A wishes to increase to a 15% reserve.So bank A wants to borrow that amount of money, which is either physical cash or reserve deposits with the Fed. Bank B has roughly that much money to lend. So bank B wants to lend money to bank A, probably overnight because people may want their money back suddenly.

So what interest rate does bank B charge to bank A?

Assume that Bank B will charge a 10% fee. Let's also say the feds decide the money supply isn't big enough. That the Fed wants to expand the money supply So what happens in this situation?

So what the Fed does is print notes and use those notes to buy Treasury bills. The cash will go to the people who sold the treasuries, and that person is going to put that cash in their bank. Some put it in bank A, and some in bank B. What's the net effect? The Fed's balance sheet increased a little bit; it took on some treasuries from the open market, and more cash got deposited in the banking system. All of a sudden, bank A needs less money because it received some reserve deposits from people. Maybe that bank now has a 12% reserve ratio, and bank B has gone from 20% to 22%. The demand for money at Bank A has decreased, and Bank B now has even more money to lend.

Now, for overnight lending, the demand has gone down and the supply has gone up. The price has got to go down for a little borrowing overnight. What's the price of borrowing? That is, after all, the interest rate. Maybe the transaction will occur at an 8% interest rate, and maybe the Fed has a target rate of 5%. So they'd just keep going through the motions.

**More on the fed funds rate**

The Federal Reserve always refers to the target rate as X. They don't talk about money. Bank B will have more reserves than Bank A before the Fed does anything. As a result, bank B may lend to other banks that require reserves or open checking accounts.Let's say bank A wants to borrow, bank B is willing to lend some, and the current rate is 6%.

Now the Federal Reserve wants to expand the money supply, which they don't tell us directly. They will say, "We're going to lower the federal funds rate to 5%." This means that their target rate is now 5%. They're going to perform open market transactions in such a way that now when the bank B offers money to the bank A, it's going to reduce its rate from 6% to 5%.

So the Federal Reserve could print some notes and buy treasuries with them. Regardless of where they purchase it, the seller will have no idea that he's selling to the Federal Reserve. The seller will look like he's selling to the market, just as if he were buying stock. You don't know from whom you're buying stock from.Now that the IOU has been exchanged for dollar bills, which he's going to deposit in the banking system, he might put some in bank A and some in bank B.

Now the bank's reserve ratio has gotten a little bit better. Its assets and liabilities have increased. The bank doesn't need money as badly to improve its reserve ratio, and bank B has an even better reserve ratio. The bank A demand for reserve ratio is a little bit lower, and the bank B supply is a little bit higher. Bank A will be willing to pay a little less for the reserves from bank B, and bank B is willing to charge less. So just by increasing the supply and decreasing the demand for reserves, if the Fed does this appropriately, it will go down to 5%. So they're increasing banks' lending capacity, which significantly increases M1.

**How do target interest rates differ from money supply?**

Why don't they simply manage the money supply by establishing a target money supply rather than a target interest rate? Why don't they just say we have a target of $900 billion, up from $800 billion? prints that 100 million base money, and M0 will get to 900 billion. You'll have the multiplier effect; lending will take place and increase the M1. Similarly, they could have the target M1. They could say we want the target to be $2 trillion. Why don't they just grow the money supply?

Maybe they could say, "Our goal for M2 is to always be 50% of GDP." So as the economy grows, we just have to make sure that if it falls below 50% of GDP, we have to print a little bit of money, and then we'll have a multiplier effect, and we'll keep measuring it. If it goes a little bit above, we'll do some open market operations and sell our treasuries and take reserves out of the banking system. That's a completely legitimate way of thinking about it, and there are two reasons why this might make sense.

The first is based on the belief that the short-term interest rates at which banks lend to one another are simply easier to measure than the money supply. I could sample the market at any moment of time.The other reason is a little bit more abstract. Let's say it's planting season. There are a couple of farm projects where farmers need money to buy seeds. The farmer will proceed if he can get loans at 20% or lower interest rates. So if someone is willing to lend at 21%, he will say no. Another farmer with an 18% interest rate project Another farmer with 12%. A factory guy with a good idea who is willing to build a factory if he can get funding at a 19% interest rate is competing with another factory guy with 3% funding who believes that the only way to move the project forward is if he can get funding at 3% or better. Another guy, who himself is not very confident, will only proceed with the project if he essentially gets money for free.

Let's say the money supply is fixed at that moment in time. Essentially, money is being lent to people who are willing to pay the highest interest rate. So for our convenience, let's assume everyone wants an equal amount of money to go with their project. The project to get the money will have an interest rate of 20%, 19%, and 18%. Let's say the interest rate is 17.9% for those three projects. Those three outstanding projects will not be completed. It's unfortunate that the 12% yield project, which is a fantastic idea, was not funded at the time.

Let's say the money supply stays constant in the medium term over the course of the year because that's what the Fed is targeting. So as we get away from the planting season, farmers' projects disappear, but if you're keeping the money supply constant, those two shady projects will be lent at a much lower rate. So you have a situation where the money supply is not elastic with demand, and the negative side effect for society is that when people needed money, we passed on good projects that really should have been done, and then later, when timing is bad and we keep the money supply constant, bad projects will get funded because there's so much money to go around and none of the people need to use it.

So this is the problem where, over a medium period of time, if you hold the money supply constant, you'll be passing up good projects when there's a lot of demand and then you'll be investing in bad projects when there's not much demand for projects.

Now, if you're managing the money supply according to an interest rate, the interest rate of the federal funds rate is the rate that banks lend to each other. When you inject reserves into the banking system, it lowers the rate at which reserves are lent to each other and also increases the lending capacity of the banks. So it expands the money supply, and expanding the money supply expands overall lending capacity, which lowers the rate at which banks lend to projects.With more money chasing the same number of projects, the cost of lending is going to go down. Let's say the Fed manages the target rate in such a way that bank lending to real projects drops to 8%. We're not fixing the money supply; we're just adjusting the money supply in such a way that the interest rate is fixed. So now, during the planting season, all projects above 8% are going to get funded. After planting season is over, we're still keeping the interest rate the same. Perhaps we will reduce the money supply in order to keep interest rates low, but only good projects will be funded.

It allows the money supply to expand and contract naturally in real time according to market demand for cash, and by setting the interest rate, you're setting the threshold over which you're willing to let projects that meet that threshold get funded.

**What happened to the gold?**

Whenever we started with our example, all the banks had gold as a reserve, and at some point they said, "Why are we each holding gold?" "Why don't we just all concentrate our gold in one reserve bank, and then that reserve bank can issue bank notes that could be tradeable for gold?" People gradually came to believe that they could use the bank notes themselves as reserves. Gold has nothing to do with the economy in our previous example, which is just giving a little confidence behind bank notes.

When we did our example, the whole point of having a flexible money supply was to be able to grow and contract money with the needs of the economy while still having outstanding notes because it's a fractional reserve system. We have more notes than the actual amount of gold. This was true even when the gold standard was in place. You had more dollars than you actually had gold. We have to keep a little bit of gold just in case people want to call your bluff. in case X percentage of people wanted their gold back. But gold itself served no other purpose. It wasn't good for the economy and wasn't helping transactions happen. To some degree, it's more of a pain than any kind of real value because you have to keep up this notion that the dollar bills could be translated into gold; it kind of forced the reserved ratio requirement on the central bank itself. The reserve ratio requirement is dependent on how much gold is found around the world. In order to increase the money supply with GDP because people are inventing computers, railroads, and cars, we're becoming more efficient, but in order to keep the money supply up with that extra economic activity if we stay on the gold standard and if we want to keep the ratios between the money and the gold, we'd have to grow our gold with the economy. That's a bit arbitrary. Maybe we can find a bunch of gold, maybe not.

The dollar bills aren't just liabilities and obligations of the central bank; they're actually obligations of the government. Would you rather have something backed by gold or backed by the government?

Most of you would say because you don't have trust in the government, but gold really isn't wealth. It can be used to represent wealth only because it's pretty and rare. It is unable to work or be eaten. Well, the government has the right and the authority to tax. It can extract rents from the country's economy, which is real wealth. That's labor, ideas, land, resources, and more. We had currencies backed by gold, but you still had inflation. In some ways, a currency backed by the whole nation's ability to generate wealth is a lot more valuable.

But gold was a stepping stone. To get things going and for people to believe in the bank notes, they had to be sold on gold first. If you trust the government's ability to manage the money supply effectively, and they're not going to print so much money that we have hyperinflation or so little money that we end up with a deflationary spiral, it really doesn't matter that we went off of the gold standard.
