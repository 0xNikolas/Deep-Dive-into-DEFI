Nathan is known for his delicious momos. It's been his dream to open a momo shop. He figures that it'll cost him $100,000 to start his business with all the supplies, staff, and other costs of starting a business. The problem is that Nathan only has $10000 to put into the momo shop. He can't build his business on $100,000.

Nathan decides to issue stocks to investors to help raise money. Stocks are pieces or shares of ownership in a company. Each share is worth a certain amount based on the company's value. A company issues shares to investors in order to raise money. Nathan decides to enlist the help of nine of his friends to invest the remaining $90000.However, to do this, Nathan must give away 90% of his business in shares. Nathan and his friends each own 10% of the business.

Five years later, Nathan Momo Shop is booming. His momo shop is now worth $1 million. Nathan got the money he needed to create the business without any additional risks or debt. Also, Nathan and his friends each turn their $10000 investment into $100000.Just like Nathan's friends bought shares in his shop, you can buy shares of publicly traded companies like Apple. If Apple has 100 shares and you own one, you own 1% of Apple.
