**Traditional Finance System**

Let's learn how a bank works. Every hardworking person in society provides a service and has savings. Their money in their house is doing nothing. They got their savings from the people for whom they'd provided service. There's some guy who has a good idea for a project for which he or she could make a decent amount of money. But how will he or she persuade others to contribute to the project? He or she could promise to give something in the future once the project finishes, but no one will be willing to work for him or her unless they feel really secure that they're going to get something in return.

We have an interesting problem. There are a bunch of people who provide services and have savings in the form of gold or paper money, and there's another group that has an awesome idea but no capital to start with. So what if the entrepreneur could borrow some savings from another group? The entrepreneur could generate wealth and share it with other groups. However, it is extremely difficult for the group to evaluate an entrepreneur's project idea, especially when the project may necessitate the rescue of thousands of people.Also, it'll be hard for one group to evaluate who has a good project and who has more savings.

Someone saw this opportunity and called a business "Bank." Let's say I have a million dollars in savings, and I've used that to build the structure of a solid, safe, and secure vault. So my "equity" is $1 million. People will be comfortable keeping their money here, and they'll feel safe too. So, instead of keeping your money insecure in your home, why not put it in my vault? If you ever need it, you can come and get it, and on top of that, I'll pay you interest. So everyone puts their savings, which, let's say, is $10 million in deposits, which is a "liability" for me because I owe that to other people. I told people that they could take money at any time, so I need to put some cash aside in case people want their money back.

So let's say 10% of $10 million is $1 million in reserve, and then I've got $9 million left that I can hopefully put to productive use. I loan that money to people who have really good projects or investments, which are "assets," because they own me that amount. I'm borrowing $10 million, keeping $1 million in reserve, and paying out $9 million in loans. A loan could be given to multiple projects.

How am I making money?

I hope to use the loan for irrigation, factory construction, or any other investments that generate more value than they cost to begin with. So I can charge interest, and it should be a cut of the value that's been created. Let's say I'm charging 10% on the loan and assume all my payout loans are on the best project. Also, I'm paying 5% interest on the deposited amount. So how much money do I make?

So I'm making 10% on $9 million, which is $900,000 a year, and I'm paying out 5% of $10 million, which is $500,000. That leaves me with $400,000 left over. Assume I spent another $100,000 on salaries, security, and other expenses. I'm netting $300,000. So in the big picture, I'm putting in $1 million every year and making $300,000 by matching up the savings with good investments, and everyone benefits.

**Income Statement**

Let's continue with the previous example where I started a bank and matched up savers with an investment opportunity. So my balance sheet for the first year is:

- One million dollars in equity
- purchased a building (a bank), resulting in a $1 million real estate investment.
- Collect $10 million in deposits.
- set a reserve of $1 million.
- $9 million loan on a good investment
- Getting 10% interest on a loan
- Giving 5% interest to savers

So what happens over the course of the year? How much interest income am I going to get? Interest income is $900,000, interest expense is $500,000, and operations, maintenance, and salaries are $100,000. I'm left with $300,000 in pre-tax earnings. So they take 1/3, so it's $100K, and I'm going to be left with $200,000, which is my "net income." This is the income statement. So what is my balance sheet going to look like at the end of the year?

$9 million of loans in my assets column
Spend some money on maintenance so that the building is still worth $1 million.
Now I have $1.2 million in reserves, and I'm assuming that my level of deposits doesn't change.
$10 million in deposits
The difference between total assets and total liabilities is defined as equity. So there are $11.2 million in total assets and $10 million in total liabilities. So $1.2 million of equity

I had $1 million of equity, and now I've got $1.2 million of equity. So the change in equity is $200,000, which is the same thing as net income. A "balance sheet" is just a snapshot of what you have and owe at a given point in time. The "Income Statement" tells us what happened over the course of the year. It tells how we got from one balance sheet to another. It tells you all of your inputs and outputs and where your money went.

So if you have a positive net income, the balance sheet equity will increase by that amount, and if you have a negative net income, the balance sheet will decrease in a year. Net income is the change in equity. Your initial equity was $1 million. So how much money did you make? It grew by $200K. So 20% is 200K/1 million. It's the "return on equity," which is the same thing as the "change in equity" / "starting equity."
