**Traditional Finance System**

Let's learn how a bank works. Every hardworking person in society provides a service and has savings. Their money in their house is doing nothing. They got their savings from the people for whom they'd provided service. There's some guy who has a good idea for a project for which he or she could make a decent amount of money. But how will he or she persuade others to contribute to the project? He or she could promise to give something in the future once the project finishes, but no one will be willing to work for him or her unless they feel really secure that they're going to get something in return.

We have an interesting problem. There are a bunch of people who provide services and have savings in the form of gold or paper money, and there's another group that has an awesome idea but no capital to start with. So what if the entrepreneur could borrow some savings from another group? The entrepreneur could generate wealth and share it with other groups. However, it is extremely difficult for the group to evaluate an entrepreneur's project idea, especially when the project may necessitate the rescue of thousands of people.Also, it'll be hard for one group to evaluate who has a good project and who has more savings.

Someone saw this opportunity and called a business "Bank." Let's say I have a million dollars in savings, and I've used that to build the structure of a solid, safe, and secure vault. So my "equity" is $1 million. People will be comfortable keeping their money here, and they'll feel safe too. So, instead of keeping your money insecure in your home, why not put it in my vault? If you ever need it, you can come and get it, and on top of that, I'll pay you interest. So everyone puts their savings, which, let's say, is $10 million in deposits, which is a "liability" for me because I owe that to other people. I told people that they could take money at any time, so I need to put some cash aside in case people want their money back.

So let's say 10% of $10 million is $1 million in reserve, and then I've got $9 million left that I can hopefully put to productive use. I loan that money to people who have really good projects or investments, which are "assets," because they own me that amount. I'm borrowing $10 million, keeping $1 million in reserve, and paying out $9 million in loans. A loan could be given to multiple projects.

How am I making money?

I hope to use the loan for irrigation, factory construction, or any other investments that generate more value than they cost to begin with. So I can charge interest, and it should be a cut of the value that's been created. Let's say I'm charging 10% on the loan and assume all my payout loans are on the best project. Also, I'm paying 5% interest on the deposited amount. So how much money do I make?

So I'm making 10% on $9 million, which is $900,000 a year, and I'm paying out 5% of $10 million, which is $500,000. That leaves me with $400,000 left over. Assume I spent another $100,000 on salaries, security, and other expenses. I'm netting $300,000. So in the big picture, I'm putting in $1 million every year and making $300,000 by matching up the savings with good investments, and everyone benefits.

**Income Statement**

Let's continue with the previous example where I started a bank and matched up savers with an investment opportunity. So my balance sheet for the first year is:

- One million dollars in equity
- purchased a building (a bank), resulting in a $1 million real estate investment.
- Collect $10 million in deposits.
- set a reserve of $1 million.
- $9 million loan on a good investment
- Getting 10% interest on a loan
- Giving 5% interest to savers

So what happens over the course of the year? How much interest income am I going to get? Interest income is $900,000, interest expense is $500,000, and operations, maintenance, and salaries are $100,000. I'm left with $300,000 in pre-tax earnings. So they take 1/3, so it's $100K, and I'm going to be left with $200,000, which is my "net income." This is the income statement. So what is my balance sheet going to look like at the end of the year?

$9 million of loans in my assets column
Spend some money on maintenance so that the building is still worth $1 million.
Now I have $1.2 million in reserves, and I'm assuming that my level of deposits doesn't change.
$10 million in deposits
The difference between total assets and total liabilities is defined as equity. So there are $11.2 million in total assets and $10 million in total liabilities. So $1.2 million of equity

I had $1 million of equity, and now I've got $1.2 million of equity. So the change in equity is $200,000, which is the same thing as net income. A "balance sheet" is just a snapshot of what you have and owe at a given point in time. The "Income Statement" tells us what happened over the course of the year. It tells how we got from one balance sheet to another. It tells you all of your inputs and outputs and where your money went.

So if you have a positive net income, the balance sheet equity will increase by that amount, and if you have a negative net income, the balance sheet will decrease in a year. Net income is the change in equity. Your initial equity was $1 million. So how much money did you make? It grew by $200K. So 20% is 200K/1 million. It's the "return on equity," which is the same thing as the "change in equity" / "starting equity."

**Fractional Reserve**

Now let's understand what money is and how it's created.

So I'm thinking that at the end of the season, all of the farmers will sell all of their apples and receive 1,000 gold pieces. They're storing these gold pieces in their house. But there are good projects and no money for those people to build those things. I could take 1,000 pieces of gold and use them for those projects, and then it would actually create wealth. So I opened the bank.

I personally have 100 gold pieces, and I constructed the building, which is worth 100 gold. Then I tell farmers that if they deposit money in my bank, I'll give them interest. So they all deposited 1,000 gold pieces into my bank. Now I have 1,000 gold pieces in liabilities because I owe them to the farmers. Essentially, I set aside 100 ounces of gold in case a single farmer withdraws the gold from the bank. I lend out the remaining 900 gold pieces. I loaned it to someone who has an irrigation project and plans to pay a lot of people with those 900 gold pieces. They plan to build an irrigation canal so that more land can be used to grow apples.

The 900 gold pieces will be distributed to irrigation project workers. After the project is done, you'll have a bunch of workers and 900 gold pieces in total. Just like farmers, they go back to my bank and deposit money my bank.So I'll set aside 10% of 900, which is 90 gold, and lend the remaining 810 to some guy who wants to build a factory. Once again, those 810 gold pieces go to the construction workers and are deposited in my bank. I could go on and on, but it's not an infinite process because with each step we get a little bit less. Let's stop it here. So I keep all 810 gold pieces as reserves. Assets are equal to liabilities plus equity.

So how much money is there in the system?

It all depends on how you define money. So I define one by saying M0, which is just how much gold is there? Counting all the reserves, we get 810 + 90 + 100 = 1000 gold. That makes sense because we started with 1,000 ounces of gold and didn't mine any.

Let's use another definition, M1, which is how much money people think they have. Well, the farmers think they have 1000 gold pieces, the irrigation workers think they have 900 gold pieces, and the factory workers think they have 810 gold pieces. So there are 27,10 grams of gold in total. This is the "multiplier effect." This happens whenever you have a "fractional reserve." This is what people say when they talk about "creating money people think they have." Well, the farmers think they have 1000 gold pieces, the irrigation workers think they have 900 gold pieces, and the factory workers think they have 810 gold pieces. So there are 27,10 grams of gold in total. This is the "multiplier effect." This happens whenever you have a "fractional reserve." This is what people say when they talk about "creating money." We've got 1000 gold pieces, and due to the multiplier effect, people think they've got 2710 gold pieces.

**The multiplier effect and the money supply**

whether it's fair for people to think that they really have the money that they have.

So after the crop was harvested, the farmer deposited 1000 gold pieces in my bank, then I lent out 900 to the irrigation project and kept 100 in my reserve. Irrigation paid 900 gold pieces to a bunch of workers, who put them back in my bank. I get 900 gold pieces as deposits, keep 90 in my reserve, and lend out 810 gold pieces to build a factory. That entrepeneur takes that 810 gold and pays the builder, which they again deposit in my bank, and I stopped the chain.

We made one definition of money called m0, which is our narrowest definition and is literally how much gold is in our system that could be immediately used for conducting a transaction. For this argument, I'm assuming none of these players kept anything in their pockets. So there are 1000 gold pieces in the bank because we originally had 1000 gold pieces.

There's more interest here if you go around the city and ask people how much money they have; they will tell you how much is in my checking account. They will tell you how much they have in their checking account. So 810 from factory workers, 900 from irrigation project workers, and 1000 from farmers, which is 2710 collectively in our checking account, which we'll call m1,

So how did 1,000 gold pieces turn into 2710 gold pieces? Does this $2710 represent real wealth or some weird pyramid scheme?

So, how did it come to be? We went through the mechanics. It represents real wealth if each of the investments in the bank were real investments. If 900 gold pieces to build the irrigation system generate at least 900 gold pieces of future wealth, then it's a real asset. Similarly, the factory But there are not 2710 gold pieces in our example world, but if the projects are real, then we do have 2710 gold pieces' worth of wealth. Gold is not wealth in itself. It's a representation of wealth. M1 was expanded to facilitate real economic production. As long as those projects generate wealth, the money supply doesn't grow faster than the amount of wealth out there. Before the gold piece bought an apple, now it'll hopefully still buy an apple.

In fact, if the investments are very good and the irrigation project goes well, we will double our apple production from 1,000 to 2,000. Likewise, the factory takes us from 2000 to 3000. So now, in a given year, how many apples are produced? If we still have 2710 gold pieces' worth of gold after producing 3000 apples, our money supply grew slower than our wealth. Money is used to transact wealth. It's not wealth in and of itself.

The ratio of gold to apples has actually improved, and now an apple is going to cost less gold before we're producing 1000 apples per year. Because of our innovation, we've experienced deflation.

**Bank Notes**
Let's go back to our example. I've got a bank that has 100 gold pieces of equity, and I use that to build a building. The builders are from out of town, so they won't deposit in the bank. All the people of town deposited 1,000 gold pieces in my bank, which is the liability. On the asset side, I have the gold pieces in my vault.

If everyone puts gold in the banks, what can they use to transact to buy food, pay for services, etc?

So, instead of taking some of your gold and turning it into money, why don't I just give you a note? a note that says, "You put x amount of gold into my vault." For example, for every one gold piece, I'll print a bank note. Then I hand you a slip of paper that only I can print. Anyone who holds the piece of paper can go back to the bank and get a gold piece. So instead of using the gold piece, people will use the slip of paper. If you give me 5 gold pieces, I'll give you 5 gold pieces' worth of outstanding bank note outstanding.Not only is your gold safe now, but you also have these pieces of paper that are extremely difficult to forge and something to trade with that is simpler than gold.

Besides securing your gold, the bank is providing a unit of exchange. This looks like our money, a dollar bill. A dollar bill is a federally reserved bank note from the US. The Federal Reserve Bank is backed by US Treasury bonds.

**Bank notes and checks**

Let's explore the notion of using something other than actual gold as a unit of exchange.So I've built my bank using 100 gold pieces, which is my equity. One of the people in my area deposited 500 gold pieces, and I asked him, "Whether you want all of it in your checking account or some cash back?" He says, "I need some cash to transact every day to buy supplies, food, etc." So put $400 in the checking account and get $100 back. So there are 100 gold pieces left. Maybe I'll hand him $5.20 for that. These are not dollars yet. These are just my bank notes. Anybody who hands me these notes will get equivalent gold pieces. 400 gold pieces are a liability for me.

A checking account is one in which you do not earn interest on your deposits but can access them at any time.

Another person, B, deposits 200 gold pieces and wants to keep half of it in cash and half in a checking account. So let's explore how transactions are going to happen between A and B.

B has an apple, and person A wants to buy it. Person A asks how much an apple costs. Well, person B says an apple costs two gold pieces. Person A says, "Well, let me just give you the piece of paper that these banks say you can trade in gold with." So person A hands over 20 bank notes; person B hands over the apples and also hands over 18 of the 1 bank notes.

What's neat here is that no gold has to be exchanged, and you're able to be very exact with the bank notes. You couldn't break gold, but a bank could issue small denominations of gold pieces equivalences.The notes could switch among people as an economy needs this function, and the bank doesn't have to worry about anything and gold doesn't have to move around.

Assume person B is a home builder, and person A is going to hire him to build the house for 200 gold pieces. But that's a huge amount of money, and nobody likes to walk around with that much money. So how about person A writes a check to person B? A check is a note that person A writes that instructs the bank to transfer that amount of gold in my name to person B. So person B builds a house, and person A writes person B a check. B can take it to the bank, and the bank will do the transfer. The bank just has to do a little bit of paperwork. That is useful because we don't have to exchange the cash.

**Giving out loans without giving out gold**

So let's again start with our example. I've used 100 gold pieces to build a bank, and I have an initial capital of 200 gold pieces. So my initial equity is 300 gold pieces. So villager A comes and deposits 100 gold pieces, and I give him the checking account. Person B comes and deposits 200 gold pieces. He gets half the bank notes and half in his checking account. So I give person B $5 in bank notes.

Now let's think about what happens when we actually start to lend some money. So in our old system, if someone had a project that required 300 gold pieces, we'd actually give them 300 gold pieces, taking them out of our vaults. They would use the 300 gold pieces to hire people or purchase supplies for their project, and those people would deposit the money back into the bank.

How could we do it without having the bank give out gold?

If safety is concerned, gold is not an easy thing to transact with. So for person C, we lend him 300 gold pieces, but instead of taking it out of my assets, I can just create a checking account for him. Perhaps a combination of checking and cash He can use the cash to pay his laborers, and if they don't want to hold a piece of paper, they can get the gold in exchange for it.

Another person comes and needs 100 gold pieces to build the factory, and I can create a checking account for him. It looks like the bank is making money out of nowhere. It looks like the balance sheet is increasing infinitely. So let's say person A is the one who can build a factory. Person D hands over a check to Person A. When A takes the check that he got from D to the bank, the bank transfers all the money from D to A.

How far can this process continue? Can a bank just continue issuing loans and checking accounts indefinitely, essentially collecting the difference in interest between the interest it gets on the loan and the interest it gives on the checking account?

No, then the bank will take on arbitrary amounts of risk, and there are regulations called reserve requirements that tell us how much lending a bank can do relative to its actual reserves, though banks would do it to some extent on their own. In this case, the reserve is gold. how much checking and bank notes it can issue relative to its reserves.
