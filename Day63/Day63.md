**Connecting TradFi and DeFi**

It's how we connect traditional finance with decentralized finance. Traditional finance mostly begins with the banking system. People who have money either invest it or use it to make more money. There are also people who don't have enough money but want to start with their ideas so they can make more money. So the bank fulfills both their demands. A person with money deposits who needs money gets a loan from the bank and pays the interest to the bank. That's how lending and borrowing are done.

We have the same thing in decentralized finance. We've got protocols like AAVE, COMPOUND, and more, and they do essentially the same thing. They take deposits and give loans to the people. These loans are "collateralized" because it's still a developing system and we haven't figured out uncollateralized loans yet. But it's completely trustless; you don't need any KYC, and it really cuts out the whole banking system's risk. For example, in the current banking system, if the bank starts to make unreasonable demands like KYC, you just have to comply because the bank holds all control over your funds. In defi, you have complete control because you know what the smart contract and code are doing. You can deposit 100 ETH and get a loan for, say, 50 ETH worth of a different crypto currency, like chainlink. If you have collateral, you can get a loan for anything you want, pay interest on that loan, and get your collateral back.

Traditional finance exchanges are known as stock exchanges or currency exchanges, and they involve exchanging one asset for another or converting one asset into another, as if you were exchanging money for Meta stock. We have the same in decentralized finance, called DEX. They exchange one type of crypto currency for another type of crypto currency. If you have ETH and you want to exchange it for BTC, you can go to UniSwap, send them your ETH, and the UniSwap smart contract will give us BTC back at the price you agree upon. The way this is different from traditional finance is that you don't have to trust the exchange. Uniswap is a bunch of code that everyone can see on the Ethereum blockchain, and you can make sure you won't be cheated. In traditional finance, you have no such guarantees. You send your money to your broker, and your broker might run away with it, or your broker might not even open an account for you. You need the permission of the broker, which might get rejected, and you have to trust them.

The next are derivatives, which are futures and options. Just as you have futures and options in traditional finance, you have them in DEFI as well so that you can have trustless, collateralized trades, and they're still figuring that out. There are protocols like Synthetix that allow you to trade auctions in a decentralized way.

Asset management is the next big thing. Let's say you're a rich person. You can give your money to your fund manager, and this fund manager is going to invest the money on your behalf and give you the return on the investment it has made. In exchange for his work, he's going to take a small fee. We've got products that essentially do the same thing in decentralized finance. The advantage of DeFi is that you don't have to trust a fund manager to do this thing.You can take a protocol that's doing the strategy of investment and have it trustlessly do that strategy over and over again through a smart contract. The protocol for this is a set protocol.

Next are decentralized payment technologies. The aim here is to make transactions fast and cheap and to add more features to them. Sablier has developed a technology called "payment stream" that allows people to be paid in real time. In traditional terms, if you hired a consultant, you would have to pay them by the hour. But let's say that in the first 15 minutes you realized that the guy didn't know about the work; you'll pay him for that for an hour. Wouldn't it be nice to have a system to pay someone by the milisecond? You can start paying them in miliseconds, and after 15 minutes, you can decide not to continue the session. All these innovations are happening in Defi, and they're there to make payments smoother, cheaper, faster, and give you all sorts of features that are not possible in TradiFI.

## Stablecoins

**Volatility**

It's an up-and-down market movement. Let's assume you want the stock to be at one price  but over a short period, it drastically goes down or up. Calculated as a standard deviation from expectations, such movements reflect volatility. If a position goes through remarkable changes in value, we call it highly volatile. vice versa; low volatility means a position is stable. High volatility brings uncertainty and scares people. At the same time, highly volatile positions can generate a lot of profit if you're willing to take a risk.

How to determine the crypto volatility?

Trace the trend. Look at the volatility of the crypto chart and analyze the severity of a crypto market price fluctuation. The more voilent the ups and dows of the crypto, the more volatile it is.

Volatility helps you realize whether a crypto fits your portfolio or not. It's up to you to decide whether to take an extreme ride or an easy slide.

**Liquidity**

It's the availability of liquid assets to a company, market, or trader/investor. Consider it an infinite series of intermediate stages such as 10/90, 30/70, and so on. Assets can be fully liquid, like water, fully frozen, like ice, or anywhere in between.

** Company liquidity**

If you review a company's financial statements, liquidity means the ability to pay short-term obligations. An example is the CFO stating that his company has ample liquidity of $3 billion: $2 billion in cash and $1 billion in a revolving loan (also called a revolving credit facility: a loan where the funds are drawn and repaid as needed by the borrower.) If you want to review the liquidity of a company from its financial statements, the `current ratio` is a very useful financial ratio.

For US reporting purposes, the assets of the company are listed from the most liquid at the top to the least liquid at the bottom. Cash is very liquid. In most cases, you can use it to pay your obligations immediately. Accounts receivable are very close to cash. Once the customer pays you, you can use that cash to pay your own bills. Inventory is still reasonably liquid, but you have to sell it first and collect the receivables for inventory to turn into cash. Fixed assets are not very liquid. To convert them into cash, you will need to produce product on them, sell the product, and collect the receivable. Goodwill is an example of an intangible asset that is very illiquid.

**Market liquidity**

When I look at the most active crypto in Coinbase, I see bitcoin and Ethereum.These are heavily traded cryptos with billions of dollars of transaction volume on normal days. That's the first version of defining market liquidity: having lots of buyers and sellers available, forming an active market. A second version is the ability to buy or sell something without causing a large price change. If I need to liquidate my portfolio today, will I be able to do so at stable prices, or will my selling cause a price drop, which would decrease the amount of cash I get in return for selling my stocks?

**Trader/Inverstor liquidity**

Suppose Jim has invested directly in private companies, real estate, and vintage cars. Jane has invested in blue-chip stocks and bonds and holds cash. You could say that Jim's portfolio is largely frozen or illiquid, while Jane's portfolio is relatively liquid. We're not looking at their returns here. We're only judging how flexible the investment portfolios are in exchanging assets for other assets. If Jim and Jane both love art and go to an auction, who is in the best position to bid? Most likely, that would be Jane. She can pay in cash or quickly sell stocks or bonds on the day of the auction.

**Collateral**

It refers to an asset that a lender accepts as security for a loan. Essentially, collateral is an item of value used to secure a loan. It acts as a form of protection for the lender. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender has a legal right to seize the collateral and sell it to recoup its losses.

**Floating and Fixed Interest Rates**

Fixed exchange rates mean that two currencies will always be exchanged at the same price, while floating exchange rates mean that the prices between each currency can change depending on market factors; primarily supply and demand.

The benefits of a floating exchange rate are:
- It reduces the need for currency reserves.
We know that large amounts of currency reserves are required by central banks or governments to maintain fixed exchange rates.With a floating exchange rate, there is no need to mess around with holding lots of currency reserves.
- Freedom for domestic money policy
    -          Some fixed exchange rate systems will require the manipulation of interest rates in order to keep an exchange rate fixed to a certain currency, whereas in a floating exchange rate system there's no need to worry about changes in interest rates to keep an exchange rate fixed. You can use monetary policy to deal with domestic issues in the economy, whether it's inflation, low or high employment, etc.

- Partial automatic correction for a trade deficit
   -     Consider a country with a large trade deficit, implying negative net exports. There's more supply of the currency in terms of buying imports than there is demand for that currency. So on a very simple currency diagram, supply is shifting to the right, which is lowering the value of the exchange rate as a result of imports being greater than exports, but in a floating exchange rate, increasing the supply of the currency will reduce the value of the currency, making imports more expensive and exports cheaper, which in theory can help partially correct the trade deficit.

- Useful instrument for macroeconomic adjustment
   -     Reduction in the value of the exchange rate can help prop up an economy. So if the exchange rate fell for some reason, that could help prop up export growth in the country, which can help increase general growth in the country. So, for countries that rely heavily on exports, the fall in exchange rates may increase export demand and exports. So it can be very useful to just help solve potential low growth issues in the economy.
- Reduced risk of currency speculation
    -     A floating-point exchange rate reduces the possibility of a currency being overvalued or undervalued. In a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate should reach an equilibrium that reflects purchasing power parity; in this sense, the currency is perfectly valued, rather than over or undervalued.Therefore, the risk of speculative attacks, especially when the currency is overvalued, is less likely to occur. Hence, more stability is likely in that sense with the exchange rate at its correct level.

However, there are some issues with floating exchange rates.
- Volatility
    -     There's no guarantee that floating exchanges will be stable. They're left open to the forces of demand and supply, and everyone knows the exchange rate can go up and down. It can be very volatile. The problem with that is that it can reduce the incentives for foreign investors or foreign companies to actually invest in the domestic country, where the exchange rate is very volatile. It puts off trades as well, so for exporters domestically, it becomes harder to trade because foreign countries don't really know what they're getting in terms of currency with the domestic currency constantly going up and down.
- Self correction of trade deficits is unlikely
  -     When we discussed sub-corrections in Point 3, it was primarily theoretical; in practice, it is unlikely to occur because imports and exports are only two of the factors that can affect the demand and supply of a currency. There are loads of other factors that are way more dominant, like speculation. In fact, speculative flows are way more likely to affect demand and supply and change the exchange rate's value than a current account deficit is. So in that sense, the demand for imports and exports is fair enough to have an impact on the exchange rate, but nowhere near as big as speculation, which can actually stop the number 3 point.
  -     We can also bring the concern about inflation rates.Think about an economy that's suffering because of high levels of inflation  and as a result, it's struggling to export, which maybe means that net exports are negative, but we've already said that that's going to  put downward pressure on the exchange rate because the supply of the currency is going to be increasing more than demand for the currency, which lowers the exchange rate. While trying to correct the trade deficit problems, the lower exchange rate will actually push up inflation again. So if high inflation is causing a problem, reduce export competitiveness. A lower exchange rate could worsen the inflation problem through higher import prices and through high demand-driven inflation as well. As a result, there is a risk associated with a floating exchange rate that includes inflation.
