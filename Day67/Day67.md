# Decentralized Exchanges

A DEX is an exchange that is inherently decentralized. Traditionally, exchanges have been run by centralized companies that are responsible for all aspects of how the company operates. Normally, entities known as "market makers" form the backbone of all trading on a platform by providing the majority of liquidity. This is usually from the reserves that the exchange itself is holding or from major players operating on the exchange. By placing orders on both the buy and sell sides of the order book, they make it possible for other traders, called market takers, to be able to execute their own trades with maximum efficiency. DEX, however, handled all of this with pure code, meaning there's no central authority that has any power over the system. This is made possible because of smart contracts that act as automatic market makers. AMM acts to guarantee liquidity Â in the market via algorithms instead of any human intervention.

The liquidity comes from providers, which could be anyone who is incentivized to lock their tokens into liquidity pools in return for a share of all network fees. DEXs can offer virtually all the functionality of a centralized exchange but with notably lower fees, no KYC requirements, and no type of registration. This has many benefits and is attractive to a variety of users, but it's also completely unregulated and, as such, comes with some level of risk.

**DEX risk**

While it's true that you don't have to trust a person or a company, you do need to trust the smart contracts you're interacting with. There are still some potential issues to consider. One is called `slippage` which means the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price that gets executed. This can happen because the market moves just as an order is going through, or when liquidity is too low, the trade itself can actually move the market quite a bit. There are usually some safety nets in place. If a user isn't careful, they can end up paying more or receiving less than they had originally anticipated.

This is best combated by paying close attention to the amount of liquidity available for the asset you're trying to exchange and avoiding small volume pools. Services like Uniswap offer the ability to set slippage tolerances that will cancel a trade if it's going to move the price past a certain percentage, which can certainly help to at least mitigate some mistakes.

One more serious issue to watch out for with DEXs are scam tokens. Since everything is user-run and unregulated, often anyone can deploy a new asset to the ecosystem. While this gives freedom and flexibility to project developers, it also paves the way for scammers to make virtually identical copies of existing tokens, all in the hopes of confusing users who are trying to purchase the real asset. The name and icon can be exactly the same; the only obvious difference will be the address of the smart contract you're interacting with. This is why you should always follow official links from the developer's website when looking to trade new tokens on DEXs. By sticking only to verified links, you should be able to avoid scams.
