# Decentralized Exchanges

A DEX is an exchange that is inherently decentralized. Traditionally, exchanges have been run by centralized companies that are responsible for all aspects of how the company operates. Normally, entities known as "market makers" form the backbone of all trading on a platform by providing the majority of liquidity. This is usually from the reserves that the exchange itself is holding or from major players operating on the exchange. By placing orders on both the buy and sell sides of the order book, they make it possible for other traders, called market takers, to be able to execute their own trades with maximum efficiency. DEX, however, handled all of this with pure code, meaning there's no central authority that has any power over the system. This is made possible because of smart contracts that act as automatic market makers. AMM acts to guarantee liquidity  in the market via algorithms instead of any human intervention.

The liquidity comes from providers, which could be anyone who is incentivized to lock their tokens into liquidity pools in return for a share of all network fees. DEXs can offer virtually all the functionality of a centralized exchange but with notably lower fees, no KYC requirements, and no type of registration. This has many benefits and is attractive to a variety of users, but it's also completely unregulated and, as such, comes with some level of risk.

**DEX risk**

While it's true that you don't have to trust a person or a company, you do need to trust the smart contracts you're interacting with. There are still some potential issues to consider. One is called `slippage` which means the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price that gets executed. This can happen because the market moves just as an order is going through, or when liquidity is too low, the trade itself can actually move the market quite a bit. There are usually some safety nets in place. If a user isn't careful, they can end up paying more or receiving less than they had originally anticipated.

This is best combated by paying close attention to the amount of liquidity available for the asset you're trying to exchange and avoiding small volume pools. Services like Uniswap offer the ability to set slippage tolerances that will cancel a trade if it's going to move the price past a certain percentage, which can certainly help to at least mitigate some mistakes.

One more serious issue to watch out for with DEXs are scam tokens. Since everything is user-run and unregulated, often anyone can deploy a new asset to the ecosystem. While this gives freedom and flexibility to project developers, it also paves the way for scammers to make virtually identical copies of existing tokens, all in the hopes of confusing users who are trying to purchase the real asset. The name and icon can be exactly the same; the only obvious difference will be the address of the smart contract you're interacting with. This is why you should always follow official links from the developer's website when looking to trade new tokens on DEXs. By sticking only to verified links, you should be able to avoid scams.


**How a Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange Works**

On Ethereum, DEX allows us to trade ERC20 tokens for other ERC20 tokens. In DEX, you have to manage your funds yourself, and the benefit of this is that exchanges could get hacked and you could lose all your funds.

The DEX allows you to trade Ethereum-based tokens from one wallet or one account with another wallet or another account, and the funds never leave your wallet until the trade actually happens. So if I'm a maker and I submit an order and a taker takes the order, the exchange does the swap of tokens and never holds on to them in the middle. You don't have the vulnerability of the smart contract being hacked and your funds being siphoned out.

If I'm using an exchange like Uniswap, I need to have some crypto funds. I have to use a browser extension like Metamask to manage crypto funds, fill out the order, submit it, and the taker will take that order. So this is a high-level overview. So you need to bring your own wallet to an exchange  and then DEX will basically take your orders.

DEX uses a protocol, which is a project that has its own Ethereum-based token and is a protocol for creating decentralized exchanges. It's a protocol for taking orders that you see on an exchange and putting those on a server that isn't necessarily decentralized. This is called a relayer, and it just relays orders. It needs to be fast because there's a transaction limitation on the Ethereum blockchain, and it needs to create orders and fulfill them really fast. But your orders are secure. Your funds never go to that server. It's just your intent. Whenever someone takes your order, the relayer basically talks to smart contracts on the blockchain that take your funds and perform `atomic swap` which basically takes the funds from one ERC20 token to another ERC20 token and transfers the balances instantly.

You do have centralization features like 0x Relay, but they don't expose you to the same kind of vulnerabilities that a traditional crypto currency centralized exchange does. The centralized feature of the relayer is to make orders faster and support higher volumes of trading. To trade Ethereum for other ERC20 tokens, ether itself needs to know how to act like an ERC20 token, which it doesn't do natively. To turn ether into a token, you have to wrap it in a smart contract that has a one-to-one relationship between the ether balance and the WETH.
